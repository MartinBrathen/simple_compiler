# What I learned during the course

- Memory safety. I have noticed while programming in other languages, such as c++, that I am thinking more about memory
safety now, compared to before I started this course.
- How to use parser combinators for quickly writing parsers.
- How programs are structured into ASTs before compiling or interpretation.
- I learned that programs can be compiled into an intermediate representation, to allow for quick and easy compilation into
machine specific to different platforms.
